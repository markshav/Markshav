In 1999 I released HFNetChk — the first agentless patch scanner for Windows NT. Microsoft partnered with me to build it into the **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA)**, which went on to scan over 3 million computers per week. I founded **Shavlik Technologies** to turn that work into a full patch management platform, which was acquired by VMware in 2011 and ultimately became part of Ivanti.

On the 25th anniversary of launching HFNetChk I'm back in patch management. There is no public patch repository and no simple scanner for it — and there should be.
